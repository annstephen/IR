Files included:
tfIdf.py
boolMatch.py
inverseDict.py
textPro.py
README.txt

Part 1:
running boolMatch.py executes the boolean match program that returns a list of docIDs containing all terms in the query.

Part 2:
running tfIdf.py executes the TF-IDF program, returning the list of docIDs with the associated scores. 

Both these programs require the folder location to be given as an input before the files are processed. All .txt files within this file and it's sub-directories will be processed. Since I included the repository in the same folder as my python files, typing in 'nsf-award-abstracts/nsf award abstracts/' will process required files.
Once the processing is done, queries can be accepted. -1 is used to exit the program. 

This program was developed and tested in a linux environment on python 2.7.4
